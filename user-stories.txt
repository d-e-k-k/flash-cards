MVP  GOALS
    • As a user,  I would like flash cards that flip front and back so I can test my self and only reveal definitions when I need them.
    • As a user, I want to click on the cards to have them flip as well as use the arrow keys so I can move through the cards and flip them quickly.
    • As a user, I would like some pre-loaded cards so I do not have to create content if I don't want to.
    • As a user, I want to be able to mark which cards I got right so I know which cards I am struggling with.
    • As a user, I would like cards that I don’t know to re-display until I get them right so that I can be confident I know the material.
